Hi! Dear friends! I feel very sorry for it. Many of the emails I have received at recent time reflect the timeout of withdrawal contract: (The reason is mainly caused by the long cycle of lottery calculation and the poor performance of the main network). I will give the unified reply here: Since the contract has been run, it's impossible to make any changes. The only solution is to upgrade the main network of TRON. It is believed that the super node of the main network of TRON will be solved. In addition, we have also contacted some super nodes of TRON, but it needs to take some time. Please wait patiently! Of course, we also know that the development progress of our cause will not be affected. Please rest assured that our funds will be very safe, and we are also promoting the construction of the main network. Letâ€™s see it.
